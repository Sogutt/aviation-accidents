everything worked properly.we prepared to push back and continue our flight. just prior to push (i had to call for another live calculation as runway 9 was now closed), the apu died unexpectedly at the gate. that was deferred and we proceeded to [destination]. all told, i made a dozen calls to dispatch over deferrals (the hi stage deferral wasn't listed and we added the apu later), three calls for the live calculation, one for runway 9, one for 8r and then another for 8r with a deferred apu. to add to the confusion, up until we were ready to push with the apu deferred, we did not know if we were going to [our second leg], as a recovery flight had been launched to [for the second leg]. we were told to fly to [destination] as planned, but be prepared to be rerouted to our [a second destination] enroute. as we are fueled for both legs, it wasn't an issue. we landed [at destination] and the recovery flight\\nwas turned around.the next leg was normal until landing. i have flown this route for the last two months and i am very familiar with it, but we were hours late and had faced a slew of unexpected changes and challenges. i had slept great prior to the flight and felt sharp but as we approached [the airport] a bit of mental fatigue was setting in, likely due to the adrenaline wearing off. to help minimize potential threats, i elected to brief a cat i auto-land. weather was clear and unrestricted, winds 190/10. the airplane overshot loc intercept due to strong quartering tailwinds, but corrected and was lined up properly. however, on short final, the airplane was increasingly right of centerline. it appeared as if we would touchdown with the left main gear on or right of centerline. our wheelbase is 30 feet and runway 9 is 150 feet wide, so i knew we would land on the runway, but i was not happy with landing so far to the right. i elected to turn off the autopilot and land manually. i am unsure of my altitude when i disconnected, as i was focused on our lateral track.this is a challenging run to begin with. three legs a night is draining and delays remove any chance of a break during our planned 3-hour stop. we typically change planes in [our second destination] and for the two months i've been flying it, it seems that one of the aircraft has issues with repeated write-ups. this flight had an unusual number of distractions, from being over fueled, needed a max thrust takeoff and a live calculation (three times...) , plus the r hi stage deferral, which should've been on the release, the unexpected lack of duct pressure with no explanation, and then the apu suddenly dying as we tried to depart again.as a crew, i felt we dealt well with the constant changes. we have flown together all this month, and my first officer, although in his first year at [company], flew the 767 at a previous carrier has been a great resource on every leg. the first two legs this night felt like the check ride that wouldn't end. it is becoming a rare relief to get an airplane with no deferrals that behaves as expected. (thankfully, the last leg of this day was the low-key, good airplane leg we needed after a long night.) although things went normally once we departed until the landing, we were hours late, which compressed our scheduled turns.as a crew, we verbalized taking our time and making sure everything was right, without regard to time pressure and pushed back when we were ready. my biggest regret of the evening was the landing [last landing]. i may have turned off the autopilot below 100 agl, i honestly don't know. i should've gone around and set up for another approach. it was a split second decision that i felt comfortable with because the weather was not a threat, visibility was excellent, and most likely, even letting the airplane auto-land right of centerline probably would have been fine but i did not like the airplane landing much farther to the right than i was expecting. the problem was i had briefed an auto-land, and turning off the autopilot at low altitude wasn't what i had told the first officer to expect. certainly i would've gone around under those conditions had weather been any kind of a factor. i was happy with the result, a landing closer to centerline, but not with doing something contrary to what my partner was expecting. the main point of this [report] is the effect repeat write-ups is having on operations. but i do have to recognize the effect the current atmosphere at my airline is having on our behavior out on line. this had no conscious effect on my decision to land manually instead of going around, but lately i have been taking notes on each departure to explain delays, to defend myself in case i am questioned. certainly, that thought crossed my mind during the gate return. are they going to question whether this was a legitimate return? did i miss something? i'm pretty good at compartmentalizing, but that is increasingly becoming a contributing factor.synopsis\\na boeing 767 captain reported that they returned to the gate because the right hand side did not have duct pressure, which started a chain of events prior to takeoff.\\n\",\n",

the agent on the jet bridge said she saw the tow bar was an issue but had no way to alert us in time. is there a communication channel input to the parking guidance system that would facilitate a stop input to the guidance display from the jet bridge and ramp? maybe hand held vhf communication set to the ramp frequency for urgent safety communication only. i accept full responsibility for the safety of my aircraft, crew and passengers but my job is made much more difficult by poor ramp training and control which set the trap for this incident. i often feel that the pilots are the sole safety layer in the miami ramp area instead of being the final layer.[suggest] having a person actively monitoring an aircraft being guided in by the automatic guidance system, positioned where a stop signal can easily be seen by the captain. if there is even the slightest distraction during the parking process, stopping until the issue is resolved or stop and get towed to the gate. over 25 years of flying, i have never once had to stop to have someone clear an obstacle in the safety zone. arriving in miami on the other hand, it is a regular occurrence. we regularly have had to stop and gesticulate to ramp personnel about an obvious object in the safety zone. it points to a lack of training, management and accountability for safe ramp operations. having ramp personnel not park, stop or place any equipment in the safety zone except when servicing an aircraft at the gate. before the aircraft is pushed back, the safety area should once again be cleared until the arrival of the next aircraft. a zero tolerance policy should be adopted. whoever turns the automatic gate parking guidance system on should be responsible for the safety zone being clear before turning the system on and a log should be placed next to the switch where a name, employee number, time and initial has to be entered, accepting\\nresponsibility for the area being safe for an aircraft to enter the gate area before turning the automatic guidance system on. i also believe that better ramp control of the alley between concourses could improve safety and on time performance. on numerous occasions, i have had to hold while an aircraft is pushed back and disconnected in front of my gate when more proactive controlling could have had them instruct the crews to push further back or pull forward to a clear area before disconnecting to avoid unnecessary delays. this causes frustration for the crews with the associated negative impact on safety. the agent at the jet bridge waiting for an aircraft arrival could be another safety layer, inspecting the safety area from the jet bridge and alerting someone if a safety issue is noticed. an accountability program being put in place. inbound aircraft noticing a safety issue could for example say \"snapshot gate #\" on ramp control and the event is documented and an immediate call is made to the crew chief or implicated party requesting a reason for the safety issue. it could be tracked by a simple program.a program of the gate camera system being used to scan the safety area prior to each aircraft arrival and immediate notification to a crew chief or a mobile safety monitor to resolve an issue before the aircraft even enters the ramp area. random safety audits by a ramp supervisor of gate areas prior to aircraft arrival. too much burden is being placed on cockpit crews dealing with these unnecessary safety distractions. the crews have often had long and often stressful days due to weather, terrain, passenger, technical challenges and they should never be placed in jeopardy situations by completely avoidable situations caused by poor ramp control and management.synopsisb757-200 captain reported contacting a tow bar attached to a tug as he parked using an automated parking system in mia.\\n',\n",

accept an assignment to a fdp (flight duty period) if the flight crew member has reported for a fdp\\ntoo fatigued to safely perform his or her assigned duties.[company] delivered an unequivocal message to the pilot group to increase the acceptance rate of fdp extensions. further operational pressure has also been reported to me monthly by pilots in the recurrent training classes i am responsible for teaching as well as line pilots i fly with. i have brought these concerns about operational pressure negatively impacting the fatigue program and operational safety to my supervisor in an effort to address them, but his response was to either toe the company line or remain silent when the company\\'s operational pressuring tactics are raised by pilots in class.during the day and flight segment specific to this report, i witnessed firsthand the operational pressure exerted by the company when i was reassigned to operate a flight that would require me to extend my far 117 duty day. on this day i attempted to provide the company with sufficient time to address any operational issues associated with my inability to accept an fdp extension, and these were ignored or forgotten about. over the course of the day [i] reported to several different company employees, several times that i would be unable to accept the flight assignment that would require an extension beyond my 117 limits and each time i did i received operational pressure from the crew scheduler and the duty pilot i spoke to. this included questioning my fit for duty assessment by characterizing me as \"unwilling\", implying that the length of time of the extension was not substantial, drawing attention to the lack of other crewmembers available for the flight segment in question, as well as consequences to the operation if i did not accept, re- iterating that it would only extend my duty period that \"everyone wins, we don\\'t take a cancellation and you get to go on your days off and go on vacation.\" under threat of disciplinary action i was forced to accept a flight segment i knew would result in the rolling of my day off.once at the outstation in zzz i had to call crew scheduling again, telling them i would be unable to operate the flight back. instead of immediately terminating the fdp there was further questioning of my fit for duty assessment thereby delaying the operational response and delaying my rest opportunity. by continuing the fdp after multiple notifications the company was in violation of 117.5 (2) \"immediately terminate a flight crew member\\'s fdp if the flight crew member does not affirmatively state before beginning a flight segment that he/she is fit to safely perform the assigned duties.\" in addition the operational pressure exerted on myself and other crewmembers by front line crew schedulers, supervisors, duty pilots, chief pilots, and senior management, runs contrary to the stated language of 117 ii 1. c. ii whereby the faa strongly encourages certificate holders to voluntarily terminate the fdps of flight crew members who are showing signs of fatigue.the operational pressure from the company by crew schedulers, supervisors, duty pilots, chief pilots, and senior management, that might have influenced my decision and many other pilot\\'s decisions to accept a flight segment when they are not fit for duty, [could] lead to an incident or accident because of fatigue. whenever a pilot reports they are unable to accept a 117 extension any questions or conversation from the company should only be related to the safety of the flight segment in question and whether or not the crewmember is fit for duty. any other questioning or conversation can only be interpreted as coercion through operational pressure. at the first notification of an inability to extend the company should comply with 117 and reassign the flight segment to another crewmember rather than hope the pilot will go against his better judgement and fly in a fatigued state in order to solve operational problems caused by insufficient staffing by the company.\\nsynopsisair carrier captain reported receiving pressure from company

(i usually wait for verification on mel amendments from the pic before returning aircraft to service.)after the flight had reached 10,000 ft i sent an acars to the aircraft asking if they had\\nreceived the amended release, but probably since it was a short flight and the acars was deferred didn\\'t receive a response. i called the captain after they landed and he already realized he had forgotten the amendment and was planning on filling out a [report].i think the crew got busy working up the manual manifest and was rushing to go since the ground delay was cancelled, so when they got their new clearance they just thought they were good and forgot they were missing the amendment.crews should have more responsibility in the amendment process. the [manual] states that it is the responsibility of the dispatcher to ensure the crew has received an amended release, but i have no sure way to stop them departing short of pulling the strip whenever an amendment is required and refiling once the amendment is verified. in the case of added/removed mels i feel the crews are already or should be aware that an amendment is required without the dispatcher telling them so.narrative: 3[report narrative contained no additional information.]synopsiscrj-200 flight crew and dispatcher reported the hurried crew departed without a new release.\\n',\n",

(i had selected 'vector to final' and failed to eliminate the discontinuity between klide and hivak.) this was promptly corrected but it compounded the issue because it delayed pulling the speed back to 210 and delayed the descent when we could not afford both. at 245 knots i called for gear down in an initial attempt to slow down/ get down but after a few seconds, i realized this wasn't going to work as we were not even flaps 1 and 1500' high (at ~4200') 3-4 miles from faf hivak (2700') we had a slight tailwind also. i told the fo of my intention to go- around and asked him to bring the gear up he then asked 'did you hit toga?' i knew i had not (and didn't intend to at that point in time, but i doubted my plan given that we don't do soft go-arounds at this airline.)the decision to go-around was absolutely correct, but if ever there was a time to do a soft go-around; this would have been it. i immediately second-guessed what i was doing and selected ga (after having a moment and accidentally deselecting/reselecting the auto throttle). we were ~4000' and given runway heading and 3000, so we now also had a descent. between the descent and selecting ga we were up to 260 knots beneath the edge of the sfo bravo shelf. we should have been at 200. atc gave us a right turn to the northeast and a climb to 6000 to re-sequence us for another rnav y to 30l. this helped get the speed under control and gave us time to complete all announcements/ checklists and we subsequently made an uneventful landing. this debacle was unfortunate because although atc put us in an undesirable position at klide (high and fast) 1). i should never have made that error loading the approach and 2) i failed to fly the plane despite knowing that ga would put us in a bad position. there was no rush; i should have continued to slow and taken a moment to brief the best way to manage this particular situation. both fatigue and emotional state were absolutely contributing factors in my errors as i received this assignment at the very end of 5 days of sitting reserve under the new regime and having an argument with scheduling over this assignment. it seems contradictory to say; but at the same time i also feel that a lack of flight hours in recent months has also degraded my performance as i have been only averaged 35 hrs/month over the past year.synopsisair carrier captain reported atc requested 250 kts approaching kilde, but after overshooting final, failed to slow and descend sufficiently so executed a go-around.\\n\",\n",

finally found the flying first officer who had been at the aircraft struggling with loading the fmc who told me about a looming flight attendant duty expiration and that the aircraft was boarded already. he also was unable to see his assignment nor the flight plan on the ipad app; i proceeded to the aircraft to ascertain the flight attendant situation, as we still did not have our relief pilot, and briefed the customers and flight attendants and csr\\'s as to our progress; finally received release 4 and printed the package as the relief first officer arrived; all went to the aircraft and proceeded to preflight and load; still big problems loading the flight plans, winds, etc., plus we were still not showing as the pilots of record in acars; multiple calls to dispatch and the [duty manager] for help; finally pushed, but revised clearance from atc came across and we loaded it, an entirely new route and track; push crew was unable for a reported tug or tow bar issue to push us to the spot ramp control wanted us, but ramp control said we would be fine; after disconnect and salute, i called dispatch to clarify what was going on with the route as we were indicating insufficient fuel; she determined that the re-route was the original release from earlier in the evening and refilled; meanwhile we were blocking the alley for multiple aircraft; by this time, with a messed up fmc route and release verification (we still weren\\'t showing as the pilots of record in acars) i was resistant to start and move the aircraft and burn down our fuel until we at least had a valid flight plan that matched ours, dispatch\\'s, and atc; enduring repeated badgering by other pilots waiting for access to the alley and the ramp controller, we finally decided to start, do our checklists as best we could considering the conflicted information we had, and head for the box to figure things out; taxiing, and the resultant distracting multiple taxi plan changes was probably a mistake, as it only heightened the confusion; meanwhile, whenever we were stopped, i had multiple calls from the back by flight attendants who are very fatigued and not wanting to depart (they decided they wanted to proceed after all, citing fear of reprisals, as while they were obviously very, very tired, they were technically legal) while also juggling calls to the [duty manager], dispatch, atc and ramp control; at this point, the flying first officer announced that he had had enough, and called fatigue- he felt exhausted and was making mistakes and was completely confused with the route and fmc (we all were- by this time, atc had two flight plans on file and wondered which one we wanted). all this in our weakest circadian low. after a brief discussion we all agreed to return to the gate. thanks to the supervisors who met us at the gate. valiant efforts by the crew, the [duty manager], dispatcher, csr\\'s, fueler, and push crew to get the job done.\\nsynopsisthe captain of a boeing 777 reported that after a long delay and a short turn for the crew, the flight was canceled.\\n',\n",

after the passengers deplaned. the exiting ca informed us that he wrote up the ca-side-yoke-map-light. maintenance arrived and deferred the item and a new mel was generated and a release 1 was issued. this delayed the flight even more. our fa arrived after us and upon completion of the boarding, just prior to removal of the jet-bridge she informed us that a latch in the galley would not move appropriately to secure a catering container. her concern was that the container would fall out during climb-out. i went and tried to move the latch with no effect. we called maintenance and they could not move the latch either, and removed the catering container. i called dispatch and let them know about the situation, and was told by maintenance that no log book entry was needed. dispatch and maintenance mentioned that the empty catering container weighed less than 2 pounds and would not affect the weight and balance of the aircraft and that the numbers we received for takeoff would not be affected. this situation delayed the flight even more. we were cleared by maintenance and dispatch, and were ready to depart. we did not have a ramp crew to push the plane. the jet-bridge was moved with the help of the maintenance person and another gate agent on the jet-bridge. we were able to close the main cabin door and we tested the anti- skid system with the parking break momentarily off and then placed back on. we conducted the appropriate pre-flight and push-back checklists and waited for a ramp crew to push the plane. we initiated 3 calls to operations and after waiting more than 20 minutes we had a crew to push back the plane. i made 3 announcements to the passengers during this time to inform them about the wait for pushing back the plane, and i thanked them for their patience.once the ramp crew arrived we were informed that the headset being used did not have a working microphone, but the crew could hear us. i mentioned to them that we would use hand-signals and delay the start of the engines until the push back was completed. he acknowledged by thumbs up, and gave me a sign to release the breaks. i released the brakes and mentioned to him that we would call for the push. when getting the clearance to push back the ramp control mentioned to us to contact metering prior to taxi. i mentioned to the push back driver that we were cleared to push and as we started to push back i noticed that the nose wheel steering was not in the off position. before any turns were made i moved the nose wheel steering to the off position. the push back driver stopped the push abruptly as a van raced behind us as we were pushing back and if he would not have stopped we would have hit the van going to the aircraft next to us. the push back was resumed, and immediately stopped again once a turn was initiated as he ran over the headset cord. upon completion of the push-back we initiated the engine start sequence and both engines were started. the fo was concerned about not having experience contacting metering before, and i said that i would make the call and she could listen. we called metering and there was no answer, we contacted ramp control to verify\\nand they gave us a new frequency, then metering said contact ramp for taxi, we contacted ramp and they informed us that we needed to start to taxi as two aircraft were waiting for us to move to get into the ramp area.we started to move and i realized that the nose wheel steering was not armed due to the distractions we encountered that were out of the ordinary during and after the push back. i stopped the aircraft and a steering inop caution message appeared. i turned on and then off and then on the nose wheel steering, and the system was reset and we were able to taxi out of the ramp area. as we proceeded to taxi clear of other aircraft we were able to complete an after start checklist and a taxi check up to the point of ca control check. once we stopped as we waited in line for takeoff we were number 7 and had the opportunity to set the parking brake and perform the rudder check. as we taxied we noticed the nose gear making a whining noise like a squeaky brake, but thought this to be somewhat normal as the weather was cold outside and it disappeared prior to us being number 3 for takeoff. all of the remaining checklists were completed as normal.the takeoff was normal and i was the pilot flying. we performed all of the normal calls and followed atc instructions on departure. we leveled off at lower altitudes as we climbed to our cruise altitude of fl180. upon reaching fl180 the fo said look at our gear indications. she then said, i thought i heard a thump noise. the gear indication lights were white, then the nose turned yellow slashes and then turned to red slashes, and we got a gear disagree warning message. we canceled the warning and the indications went back to yellow, then white and then disappeared. then within seconds it came back again in the same sequence as before. the fo asked about the qrh for the gear disagree, and i said yes lets run the checklist. as she was looking for the checklist, i pulled up the hydraulics synoptic page and all of the indications were green and normal levels were indicating on all systems. at this time the gear disagree indications disappeared and we continued with the checklist anyway. we complied with all of the checklist items including the last item of \"land at the nearest suitable airport\". it was decided to return to the departure airport by both the fo and me. we notified atc and informed them of our situation for an air return. we did not declare an emergency, and were given a new clearance back. i transferred controls of the aircraft and atc to the fo. i made an acars message to dispatch regarding gear disagree and problem rectified. precautionary return all systems normal. then i called the fa and informed her. then i made an announcement to the passengers letting them know the situation and the precautionary nature of our return with all systems normal.i returned to the pilot flying role and asked for a longer final and slowed to place the gear down farther out than normal to ensure proper operation. all was indicating normal and tower was informed that we were indicating all systems normal. they informed us that the arff trucks were standing by as a precaution. we landed normally, and taxied into the ramp area uneventfully. upon arriving at the gate, we experienced a wait of over 20 minutes for a ramp crew to park us. initially operations answered us to give us a gate location, but once we arrived at gate parking area the operations frequency had no reply. we contacted ramp to have them help us coordinate a parking crew. we contacted maintenance operations to inform them that we were at the gate, and could use help with ramp coordination. we contacted maintenance over 3 times and were monitoring the frequency when dispatch contacted us on the maintenance frequency, and let us know that they were trying to get us help to park the aircraft. i thanked them, and told them that i would call them on the phone once we were parked. we finally were informed by maintenance personnel that they sent someone to the ramp and were able to locate a crew to help us park. after we parked and set the break and turned the seat belt sign off, we were never given a chocks-in signal. we were motioning to the gate agent on the jet\\nbridge to notify ramp personnel that we needed a chocks-in sign. we finally got this signal, and i notified the flight attendant \"doors for arrival.\" she called me and mentioned that the ground personnel opened the door from the outside, and someone was waiting at the cockpit door waiting to talk with us. we then had someone banging on the cockpit door. i told the fo to slow down and complete the parking checklist, and then we would open the door.once the checklist was completed we opened the door and started getting questioned by someone. i said wait, who are you and then i introduced myself. he was a maintenance person, and at that moment we heard banging on the fo side of the plane. another individual was outside making hand signals to the fo. she was confused and said what does that mean; he wants us to shut down the apu... #3 engine??? i immediately said, wait, don\\'t touch anything. everyone needs to slow down and take a chill pill! we don\\'t have hand signals for these things like hydraulic systems etc. maintenance is here and they have radios to communicate. let\\'s relax and think clearly or someone could get injured. at that time the gate agent entered the cockpit area and wanted to know about the passengers. i let him know that the passengers should deplane and wait in the gate area. the maintenance person agreed that this plane was not going to leave tonight and that there were other planes available. the first officer mentioned that she was not interested in going back to zzz with lower weather and at such a late hour with the idea that we would be returning almost immediately with no time in the hotel for the rest we were expecting. i mentioned that we would work this out with dispatch. i then called dispatch on the phone. he explained that the weather was forecasted to decrease to 3/4 mile visibility with snow, and that we could not use the exemption for a high mins ca and high mins fo were the operating crew. based on this information and the fact that it was already late, and by the time we would get another plane and get to zzz we would have no time for an expected rest in the hotel. fatigue was starting to set in, and based on the situation we just experienced, and were continuing to experience, the fo and i decided that it would be an issue of safety of flight if we accepted the new assignment to take another aircraft to zzz.i informed dispatch and the dispatcher said he would transfer me to a supervisor. a supervisor answered and we were able to discuss logically the situation, and being in agreement we decided to remove us from the flight. i did ask to be connected to the chief pilot on duty to discuss the situation. the supervisor placed me on hold and to call the chief pilot. he returned to the line and said that a message was left for the chief pilot and they would call me back when both were on the line. i agreed, and at that time the fa entered and said that passengers were asking for an update. i asked, we still have passengers on board, i thought i told the [gate agent] that the passengers should deplane. the [gate agent] entered and mentioned that he just offered for them to deplane if they wanted. we still had the majority of the passengers on board. i said that i would make an announcement from the fa pa system and look the passengers in the eye and give the information from me. i let them know that the plane needed to be inspected and that they should deplane and take all of their belongings with them. one woman asked me if they would get to zzz tonight. i replied that i did not know that information yet. as i was making the announcement my phone was ringing in my pocket, and i realized operations was calling me back. i re-entered the cockpit and answered another phone call from operations. the chief pilot was on the line and everyone agreed that we should not take the flight to zzz this evening based on all of the issues, the late hour of the evening, the warning message situation, the zzz weather, the delay, and the expected return from zzz. the chief pilot agreed and so did operations. we then called crew scheduling and they wanted us to say that we were fatigued. we complied and they issued us a hotel.\\nafter about 20 minutes on hold they issued us a hotel and gave us a number. the number was called and it was the hotel in zzz. we called back and placed on hold for another 10 minutes, got another number and called a hotel where we were. we waited over 50 minutes for a van and made 3 calls to confirm the specific hotel. once the shuttle arrived it was full of the passengers from our flight that was delayed until the morning. upon arrival at the hotel our names were nowhere to be found. all of the passengers were placed into rooms and we were still waiting as we called back crew scheduling, and were on hold for another 10 to 15 minutes. we finally entered our rooms at little while later.synopsiscrj200 captain reported on a series of frustrating delays that led to a late departure. once airborne, an unsafe gear indication led to a return and a canceled

of events occurring during a two day period. the events leading up to this flight operation are discussed in my previous report and involved separate maintenance discrepancies. at the conclusion of my previous report, all pertinent maintenance discrepancies were resolved.the captain and i reported for duty mid-morning. we departed and proceeded on course. our planned cruise altitude was fl240, due to mel 21-51-xx-xx rh air conditioning pack. approximately 5-10 minutes after reaching cruise, we received multiple eicas master caution messages. i was pilot monitoring (pm) and the captain was pilot flying (pf). the first eicas message i observed was \"gen 2 off\" master caution, followed by the autopilot disconnect chime and a flash of our pfd and mfd screens. within 5-10 seconds after that message, the second eicas message i observed was idg 2. this idg 2 message posted and cleared several times, then became steady. i looked on the overhead panel and observed that the idg 2 switch-light indicated \"fault.\" the captain took the controls and began hand-flying, and asked me what the problem was. i explained to the captain that gen 2 had switched off, and we had an idg 2 fault. i told the captain i felt that the idg malfunction most likely tripped the generator offline. we also had several other eicas messages, including stab/mach trim and r wshld and r window heat messages. we then re-engaged the autopilot.the captain called for the idg 2 qrh checklist. i completed the checklist, which directed me set gen 2 to reset/off, to confirm and disconnect idg 2, and then to start the apu and turn on the apu gen. i completed the checklist and reported the pertinent checklist notes to the captain. at this point, we then ran the qrh checklists for trim and window/windshield heat messages, which all were resolved (i felt these messages all came\\nfrom the momentary power interruption when the idg/gen failed). the captain and i then discussed the scenario and felt we had completed all of the qrh checklists properly. the qrh did not advise any flight deviations, so we decided it was safe to continue our flight to our filed destination. we were in the process of contacting dispatch to ensure we could account for the apu fuel burn when we were interrupted. approximately 5 minutes after the idg event, we received an apu oil temp master caution message. the captain called for the apu oil temp qrh checklist. i ran the checklist, which first directed me to transfer the packs (one was deferred) to the engines (which had already been accomplished during climb, per the mel procedure). the qrh then asked if the apu was required. i answered \"yes\" to this question, as our apu gen was required to be operating per the idg 2 qrh checklist. the captain agreed with this. i followed the qrh, which directed us to monitor the apu indications and land at the nearest suitable airport. i discussed this with the captain, and we both acknowledged that if the apu failed, we would be down to one operating electric generator.the captain told me we would divert, and we began to split up duties in the flight deck. the captain asked if i knew of any nearby airports, and i quickly referenced my efb and the \"airports\" option of the fms mfd display. i observed an airport directly east, within 5-10 miles, of the aircraft. the captain quickly made a search of all airports within our nearest airport cone. we checked the distance to our departure airport and noted it was approximately 75 miles. thus, the captain made the decision that the nearby airport would be our best diversion point. he began to coordinate with atc, and i completed all necessary diversion tasks. i obtained the atis, conducted a landing distance assessment, modified our fms destination and flight plan, and loaded/briefed the instrument approach. the captain continued flying and coordinated with atc. the captain also momentarily asked me to help him send an acars to our dispatcher, in which we said the aircraft had multiple maintenance problems and we were diverting. the dispatcher replied and agreed, and she amended our dispatch release to reflect the diversion. the captain and i then briefed the landing, discussed any additional threats and our mitigation plan, and finally completed the normal checklists and flows. the remainder of the flight was operated without incident and within all our company procedures. due to time constraints, i did not make a pa to the cabin, but we did give our passengers the 10,000 ft sterile cockpit bells. please note the only passengers on-board were a company flight attendant and two company mechanics. thus, we felt that they would be adequately understanding of the situation, and that our flight attendant would ensure the cabin was ready for landing. the captain and i did discuss declaring an emergency, but we felt the flight conditions were safe and under control. we did agree that if the apu and apu gen failed, we would declare an emergency. upon landing, we coordinated with atc and another air carrier\\'s station and obtained a parking location. we also sent our dispatcher another acars message detailing the problems. once we parked the aircraft at the gate, the captain and i shut the aircraft down and completed all relevant checklists. the captain made a telephone call to dispatch, and i walked back into the cabin and explained the situation to our flight attendant and mechanics.the captain made two logbook entries: \"idg 2 master caution in cruise flight. complied with qrh.\" and \"apu oil temp master caution while on one [engine] generator due to idg 2 caution. complied with qrh.\" the mechanics consulted with maintenance control and began inspecting the aircraft on the ramp. one of the mechanics relayed to me the status of the aircraft when i walked out to observe their work. he said the idg on the right engine \"was most likely shot\" and pointed out the oil filter was in pressure bypass mode. he said he felt it would be unsafe to try and service the idg, but rather that it needed to be replaced. there was no oil leak observed by myself or the mechanics inside the engine cowling. the mechanic then reported to me that he checked the apu oil level,\\nand that it was \"very low.\" the mechanic reported there were no oil leaks observed inside the apu\\'s titanium box. upon further questioning by myself of how the low oil level occurred, the mechanic said he did not know. he remarked that apu oil levels should be regularly checked during crj-200 line/service checks. ultimately, the mechanics deferred the idg 2 and serviced and leak-checked the apu oil as the corrective actions for the two maintenance log entries. when i returned to the cockpit, the captain informed me that dispatch and crew scheduling had requested for us to take an far 117 flight duty period extension to complete the flight segment into our filed destination, to avoid it being cancelled. the captain and i both agreed we were tired, and after a long sit at the previous airport and subsequent diversion, did not feel safe operating past the fdp limits. thus, we rejected the extension. crew scheduling then provided all five of us (pilots, flight attendant, and mechanics) with hotel rooms. we were released from duty very late at night.day twothe captain and i reported for duty at mid-morning. we proceeded to the aircraft and began our pre-flight preparations. two mels had been applied - the idg 2 (mel 24-11-xx- xx) and apu oil check (related to idg 2). the mechanics inspected the apu oil level and made an entry in the logbook. the captain and i were satisfied with these entries and corrective actions, and the preflight inspection revealed no further abnormalities. we did also have an unrelated mel - rh air conditioning pack (mel 21-51-xx-xx), which was also satisfactory. i was pilot flying (pf) for this leg, so i conducted the departure briefing. at the conclusion of the briefing, i read through each mel with the captain and discussed operational restrictions. i observed that we were limited to a minimum flight weight of 38,500 lbs per mel 24-11-xx-xx. since our aircraft was very light (3 passengers, 2 pilots), i told the captain that we may have an issue with this limitation. we reviewed our weight numbers and confirmed that we would be landing well below this minimum flight weight for landing, as planned in our dispatch release. the captain remarked this was a \"good catch,\" and he made a phone call to dispatch. our dispatcher decided to add approximately 4,000 lbs of fuel, which would have us landing at just over 39,000 lbs. we found this to be an acceptable solution. we uplifted the additional fuel, and safely conducted the flight without incident and within all company sops.i believe the biggest threat in this situation was the cascade of multiple system eicas messages in a confined period of time. i feel that the captain and i did a great job properly managing the workload and addressing the situation in a timely manner. further, the captain was quick to divide duties on the flight deck and ensure that one pilot was flying the aircraft and monitoring atc, while the other pilot was able to perform troubleshooting and qrh duties. after the fact, i again reviewed the logbook for our aircraft. i was very surprised to find two entries a month earlier, which described almost word for word the scenario that we encountered. \"in climb idg disc status message on number 2 engine.\" \"after apu start - apu oil temp caution.\" the aircraft appeared to have diverted following these issues, as both pages stated \"zzz\" as the station. the corrective action for the idg 2 disc message was a reset/could not duplicate, while the corrective action for the apu oil temp message was adding 3/4 qt of oil to the apu. of note, the next logbook described a replacement of the idg 2 with a new unit. thus, it appears that this aircraft encountered a very similar event less than a month ago. the idg 2 was replaced, but it seems the corrective action for the apu being low on oil was simply to fill up the oil and sign off the logbook. again, this is indicative of a \"keep the airplane moving\" mentality across our company. given our apu was again low on oil, most likely there is a bigger problem with the apu on this specific aircraft that was never identified or purposefully ignored by our maintenance. lastly, after the mel 24-11-xx-xx was applied,\\nthere appears to be no \"check\" in our system for dispatch to comply with the minimum flight weight of 38,500 lbs. if the captain and i had not caught this error, we would have most likely been dispatched in a condition contrary to the mel. perhaps our operations and dispatch need to develop some kind of performance check to ensure this limitation is automatically flagged on dispatch releases in the future.i think the biggest thing to learn from this event is that it is imperative for a captain and first officer to develop a positive working synergy on the flight deck. i feel that the captain\\'s crm allowed for us to work together extremely well, and we quickly and easily completed the diversion. further, i believe this report again shows the negative safety culture of \"keep the airplane moving\" and \"controllable completion factor\" at our carrier. i believe for a write-up like this, there needs to be some kind of \"big picture\" troubleshooting, or at least a more comprehensive monitoring of the parts involved. if the apu had

human factorsnarrative: 1we had just went missed into ase and we were in the process of asking for another approach. we were on the published missed and atc had told us to expect the approach over liftt. i was trying to get the fms set back up for the approach. the fo had been really behind on the first approach and the missed. i decided to take control over the fms. in the process the fo had already started to execute some changes and the aircraft had started a turn. i told the fo to get a vector. knowing that ase airspace is rather tight with ege i knew we needed to be quick. i reloaded the fms and then tried to clean up the box as atc told us to turn direct liftt and cleared for the approach. no altitude or heading was given. things would not cleaned up correctly and i just went to green needles to intercept the loc.at that point the fo noticed the fms was on page 2 and went ahead and cleaned up the fms. the loc captured and were at 14,200. at this point i looked up to make sure we were headed in the correct direction and the entire valley was now covered in fog. i was a little disoriented as only 5 mins earlier we could see airport with a few low level clouds. i noticed a few key terrain features and knew we were headed in the correct direction. the fo was still a little task saturated and i set a lower altitude to start down and i begin to call for flaps and get the aircraft configured for landing. in the process i confused where we were on the approach and set 12,300 instead of 13,600 to cross liftt. about 3 miles from liftt atc gave a low alt alert and told us cross liftt at 13,000. i immediately turned off the autopilot and climbed the aircraft back to 13,000. at that point we were at 12,600.going missed in ase is a complex procedure and trying to get the fms reprogrammed for another approach is not easy. ase has very limited airspace and this really brings down the time you have to properly set things up. the fo is rather [junior] and the first approach he was rather behind and that led me to have to worry about more things and become task saturated. when we left the ramp, i noticed a strange mx issue with the flaps/slats indicator and we had to pull back into the ramp and have mx reset a few things. after the mx issue was taken care of we left only to be told that we had a ground stop into ase. was waited 45 mins to depart. i had also not flown in almost 3 weeks due to not being used on reserve and days off. i had also not slept well the night before and felt a little tired. i should have slowed things down to help bring the fo back into the game and\\ngiven us more time to set up and brief the approach again. i know ase pretty well and i feel proficient flying in there. i was rushed with the airspace and i should have asked for more vectors for more time. i should have transferred the controls to the fo while i took care of the fms and briefed the approach.narrative: 2we had already experienced a number of issues on this flight. the slats were meled for half speed. during taxi, we had an issue relating to proper slat position indication which required a maintenance troubleshoot. after the problem was resolved, we departed for aspen. conditions in aspen were marginal with many aircraft going missed, requiring multiple approach attempts and in some cases diversions. aspen was calling above minimums with good visibility however they were experiencing intermittent low clouds/fog. prior to departure we briefed the approach/missed approach/balked landing procedures and discussed what we would do in the event of a missed. we had enough fuel for at least two approach attempts if we deemed it safe. we shot the loc dme 15 approach, we had the runway in sight at approximately liftt but we could see a cloud on the approach end of the runway. unfortunately, the cloud was exactly over ceyag at the mda which required a missed approach. while tracking outbound on the ipkn to lindz we told aspen approach that we would like to try again. we were told to expect the loc dme 15 from ajaxx. this required a modification of our previous approach in order to not have to completely reload the approach and all the intermediate fixes/altitudes.we asked and were given a vector so that we could accomplish the task and the captain began to manipulate the fms. as he was working on the changes, approach gave us a base turn and asked to keep it tight. this caused the captain to become task saturated. i asked if i could manipulate the fms and free him to focus on flying the aircraft to which he agreed. while i was reloading the approach the controller cleared us direct liftt and for the loc dme 15. i read back the clearance however in my distraction i did not notice if he gave us a crossing altitude at liftt nor did i read one back. i was able to execute the direct to liftt and returned to monitoring our progress. we were vmc in a descent and almost at liftt when the controller instructed us to maintain 13000 until crossing liftt. at that time, i looked and saw that we were at 12,600. we began to correct the altitude when the controller gave as a low altitude alert. we were vmc with adequate terrain separation, we corrected and continued the approach. unfortunately the fog bank had completely recovered the airport and surrounding area. we went missed again and diverted.it was a challenging day at a very challenging airport. we allowed ourselves to be rushed us into a second attempt at an approach without enough time to adequately prepare. in the rush, pf attempted to manipulate the fms during a critical phase of flight and lost situational awareness. when the pm took over fms load responsibilities, he was rushed and also lost situational awareness. while the pm was loading the fms, the pf mistakenly started a descent for 12,300, the published altitude after liftt, without making proper challenge/response of altitude selection. as a result, the pm was unaware of the selected altitude change. to avoid recurrence, the flight crew need to follow sop guidance, requiring pm to make all fms changes during critical phases of flight, and requiring the pf to confirm all altitude changes in alt pre select with the pm. above all, the crew must be more assertive in communicating with atc their need to set up between approaches with such tight geographic and airspace constraints.synopsis\\nair carrier flight crew reported they received a low altitude alert from atc on approach into ase citing workload, weather, and situational awareness as contributing.\\n',\n",

when detected : in-flight result.flight crew : became reorientedassessmentscontributing factors / situations : human factors primary problem : human factorsnarrative: 1\\nwriting has always been a challenge for me but that isn\\'t why this report is so late. i find writing a report particularly hard. while it appears to be a great idea and i whole heartedly endorse it, it remains very difficult to confess a failure in performance. i wonder if there is a way to make the report more inviting and less intimidating. even if the only thing that can be done is for all who read these, keep the fact that confession is a very difficult thing to do and to exercise the awareness of that particular human component. what follows is my confession. it seems one mistake often leads to others. that certainly happened this last flight of a four-day trip. i was blessed with a good crew. two flight attendants that are both competent and pleasant to work with. my first officer has been with the company for a year and is everything an airline could hope for. his work ethic, knowledge, communication skills and relationship with the aircraft are top notch. he is more than a pilot, he\\'s a student of aviation. still, we managed to forget to go from flaps 30 to flaps 45 on final approach and once the error was discovered, we failed to go around. we landed without a problem but that doesn\\'t excuse such mistakes. i was alerted to the problem by the gpws saying, \"too low, terrain. too low, terrain.\" this didn\\'t make sense to either one of us since we had the runway in sight at 12 o\\'clock with the papi showing two white and two red. the localizer and glide slope also indicated that everything was fine. i wish it had said, \"too low, flaps.\" that was why it went off and that would have pointed our minds in the direction of the actual problem rather than worrying about running into something or gps problems. we were at the threshold and very close to the flare before i figured out we had flaps 30 and announced it. my fo said, \"flaps 45\" and i selected it. i did consider a go around but opted to continue the landing since we were so close to the flare on a runway that is very long.i don\\'t wish to rationalize bad behavior as that\\'s a slippery slope to building bad habits. but that decision to land might have been preferable to going around. as i said, we were very close to landing. a go around at that moment might have involved greater risk not because we were so low, we train to go around at the last second like that in the simulator. rather, i think the earlier mistake indicated a new found ability to make errors. i can\\'t speak for my fo but i was starting to feel a little run down and i think he might have been too. i\\'ll return to this later but first i\\'d like to look at how we got into this mess in the first place. i\\'d gotten the atis and we had briefed a visual backed up by the ils to a different runway when we were told to descend via the star to that runway. i\\'d mentioned during the brief that it was quiet and that we might be offered a longer runway. my fo agreed to accept that if it was offered. it had been rainy for a few days but the air was clear and clean as we descended. atis advised a very light wind out of the southeast. aloft it was a different story, the wind was quite strong out of the south and the autopilot had to hold a wind correction of 5 to 10 degrees to track the course. as hoped for, we were offered the longer runway. we were cleared direct to the iaf and instructed to cross at or above 4000 and to maintain 210 knots to a 10 mile final. we were already doing 210 so my fo selected 4000 while i put the runway in the fms and selected direct iaf. as we approached the iaf he selected heading sync, heading mode, green needles and approach mode. i think the combination of a very shallow intercept angle and a decreasing crosswind as we descended caused us to parallel the approach course without loc2 becoming active. i told him you need to use the heading bug to make a small left turn to get on the localizer. he did and loc2 became active. unfortunately, we were slightly above the glide slope. my fo started a descent at a rate between 1500 and 2000 feet per minute to catch the glide slope from above. that can take a while as the glide slope is \"falling away\" from the plane as you descend to catch it. he called for gear down to get ready to land and presumably to increase drag. we were going too fast to select flaps 30 and he didn\\'t call for that. i\\'m not certain but i think he had the thrust levers about 1/2 inch to 1 inch above flight idle. i believe that\\'s a common error when trying to go down and slow down. we had been instructed to maintain 170 knots or greater to a 5 mile final\\nwhich took care of itself in our descent to the glide slope. as we caught the glide slope we slowed and flaps 30 was called for and selected. during all this we were handed off to tower and cleared to land. i don\\'t know how we skipped the flaps 45 on the before landing checklist callout or the stable at 1000 ft but we did. we had a lot going on in a short period of time and skipped the things we\\'ve done every flight for many years.there are a number of things that lead to this event. i can\\'t speak for my fo but i think we were both running a little low on energy. combining that with the instruction to \"keep your speed up\" and the runway change, created the opportunity for the unthinkable. it\\'s been very difficult for me to confess this in this very public forum. it feels like i am opening myself up to some severe repercussions. i do, however, have a few ideas to reduce the risk of this happening in the future. first, calling for the gear without calling for flaps 30 makes the call for flaps 30 in the near future feel like you\\'ve accomplished flaps 45. that is the action that normally happens a short time after calling for gear down. perhaps a policy of saying, \"gear down, flaps 30, bug 165\" (as if it were one word) only when the speed allows the extension of flaps 30 would help. we use the gear to slow down sometimes and i hesitate to recommend taking that tool out of the toolkit but it should be considered. second, i think we\\'ve gotten away from making standard callouts to get configured. this might be a result of operating in the real world. atc often asks pilots to keep the speed up. we were instructed to maintain 210 to a 10 mile final and 170 to a 5 mile final. while this can be an engaging challenge when you\\'re operating at 100%, if anything goes even slightly wrong like getting above the glide slope, or if it\\'s late at night and your energy level is starting to wind down, meeting the challenge to keep the speed up can lead to trouble. i also see a lot of fo\\'s bugging 165 while doing 190 to 200, then slowing to flaps 30 speed and calling for flaps 30. this might be a result of bugging vt when flaps 20 is selected. perhaps bugging 180 at the extension of flaps 20 would help. 180 mirrors the \"flaps 30, bug 165\" call in that it\\'s 5 knots below the next flap speed and, it is a safe change to make since 180 is greater than the minimum maneuvering speed for the maximum landing weight at flaps 20. ultimately, rededicating ourselves to sticking to the \\'script\\' spelled out in the cfm can only help. third, fatigue is a tough problem. sometimes you know you\\'re getting tired but often fatigue sneaks up on you with little warning. i think the faa has given us good rules to keep fatigue from being a problem and that the airline has implemented policies and programs that go above and beyond the regulations. still, it sneaks into the cockpit occasionally and when it does, it seems to be at busy times. i wouldn\\'t say that i was fatigued when this happened nor when we shut down the aircraft and went home. but, it was late in the day and the end of a four day trip. i don\\'t know how to

perhaps. at this point i should mention that this duty day followed two near minimum crew rests (for both me and the captain). an international rest of 12 or 13 hours is simply not enough time to travel from the airport to (an often distant) hotel and back, check in and out of the hotel, eat at least once--often twice, plug in our required electronics (ipads and phones), sync our ipads, check our email for scheduling advisories, shower, shave and sleep eight hours. something has to be sacrificed and it\\'s almost always sleep. when you factor in the inevitable transportation issues (late bus, traffic congestion, etc.) and hotel issues (room key doesn\\'t work, room smells like cigarette smoke, etc) even more sleep is lost. while sleeping only six or six and a half hours may not necessitate calling in fatigued, it definitely resulted in me performing at less than 100%. [the company] needs to do their part in the fatigue mitigation process. minimum or near-minimum rest periods (less than 15 hours) should be minimized and back to back minimum or near-minimum rest periods should be prohibited.narrative: 2this was a 630,000 lbs takeoff 07r out of hong kong. we got stick shaker activation at 5000 feet and 220 knots while flying straight and level to ramen. we briefed stick shaker threat twice and it still happened. it felt like we were doing straight and level slow flight for no reason and slat retract symbol was not in view, so slats retract was called for by captain (pilot flying). first officer retracted slats and we got stick shaker activation and recovered lost about 500 feet in recovery. this happened with three sets of eyes watching! a mitigation strategy was briefed that i would speed up before slats retract. we all debriefed ourselves after the event we agreed the threat was briefed thoroughly but our mitigation strategy could have been briefed better. mitigation strategy we had 2 options request high speed which is a normal for us or brief we will retract slats until after ramen. max speed into ramen was 220 knots. iro at last moment noticed sr was covered by ge.synopsisan md-11 international relief officer and captain reported a stick shaker activation while departing hong kong when the slats were retracted below slat retraction speed.\\n',\n",

[dispatch] told me that we were over fueled and needed to burn off 2000 pounds of fuel, or we would be overweight for landing. with the current routing that was filed, we couldn't have burned off that much fuel. i asked if we could defuel and the agent said it would take too much time. [dispatch] then rerouted us over a longer route that would burn the fuel off.we got a second dispatch release, started to go over it, and were interrupted by the agent, giving us yet another release. also we were interrupted by flight attendants and ground crew who wanted to get going and wanted to know what the delay was. as i started to look at the third dispatch release, clearance delivery called with our amended clearance. i stopped looking at the dispatch release numbers to focus on the clearance. the clearance was incorrect, because atc couldn't believe we would want such a long route to go to zzz1. we explained our predicament, and got the clearance as filed.we loaded the new routing and briefed it carefully. by now both my fo and i were clearly in the yellow and trying to get back into the green. by that time, passengers had been on the aircraft and waiting at least 20 minutes, and were getting irritated. at that point we did the before start checklist and got the loading schedule. i was rushed, but trying to do things methodically; however, i missed going over the third dispatch release carefully enough and comparing the zero fuel weight and takeoff weight with what was on the loading schedule. there was a 16,345 pound difference in the takeoff weight and 16,137 pound difference in the zero fuel weight. dispatch had planned us with a full passenger load, but we only had 75 passengers. i missed it. the good news is we were at the actual weight on the loading schedule and not the planned weight on the dispatch release.once airborne i discovered the error when i had a chance to look at the release more carefully, and contacted dispatch immediately. i tried to reach zzz operations but no one\\nanswered the radio. we determined the loading schedule was correct and landed uneventfully in zzz1. all i can say is i'm sorry. i have learned a lot from this flight and will be more diligent in the future, slow down, and try to minimize the risks of fatigue, multiple interruptions and changes to our normal flow.we were late and felt rushed. we needed to slow down. we were getting tired; it was the last day of a long hard four-day trip. we could have called in fatigued, drank coffee or eaten something. we were distracted by ground crew and flight attendants and agents as we were trying to sort out the new route and communicate with dispatch. we could have told them to leave us alone while we did our job. i think the other employees might be made aware that distracting the pilots at times like this adds stress and causes errors.narrative: 2pushed back and taxi out to start cross bleed. started takeoff roll and at v1 rotate i pulled back and the yoke was very heavy, i told the ca that it was very nose heavy. trimmed out and continued on the departure. at cruise we discussed what may have happened and began looking at the numbers between the release and the load sheet and discovered a discrepancy of over 16k lbs. dispatch had planned the flight full and in actuality we only had 75 passengers. we sent acars back and forth with dispatch and determined the load sheet was correct and landed uneventfully at zzz1.minimize distractions from crew and ground ops, slow down and realize that we were getting tired and should slow down more and be extra diligent when loading performance numbers. other work groups ie. attendants and ops need to be made aware of interrupting pilots during checklists.synopsisb737ng flight crew reported multiple distractions along with being late on the last leg of a fatiguing four day trip which resulted in them departing weighing less than what was shown on the release.\\n\",\n",

had said make the left turn off at t. i switched the radio to ground and the captain took the ground frequency while i called ramp to get clearance\\ninto the gate. after i had come back to ground frequency the captain had not gotten a word in yet as the frequency was congested and there was a lot of traffic.we were still on t at an angle to b. i checked in with ground finally and stated we were off (runway 31) and joining b. ground said go straight ahead on bravo and hold short of g. there was an airbus making the turn from a to g. we were told to give way to airbus and then hold short of f.ground changed their mind and said airbus gives way to you, proceed on b and hold short of f. then ground asked if we were cleared in to the gate. i stated after 2 outbound aircraft out of the alley we were cleared into the gate. they said okay go f and a and hold short of your alley until you can get in. we taxied from b and took a left on f and a second left on a and held short of the alley while a company aircraft exited the alley. after they were clear we turned right into the alley and into the gate. we followed all of these instructions as stated.upon reaching the gate, the captain received a phone call from the tower stating we did not hold short of the taxiways we were told to on the way in. we in fact held short of g when asked and also held short of f and the ramp as we were told or until we were told otherwise. the controller also said on the phone, according to the captain, that we were originally told to turn left onto b after exiting the runway. if the case, i did not hear nor read back the instruction to turn left onto bravo.i believe we followed the instructions as they were issued. some factors though that may have contributed to any deviation that occurred according to the controllers could\\'ve been misinterpretation of the taxi instructions on our part or atc forgetting what instructions they gave us. it was the last leg of days of work for me so fatigue was starting to set in. i could have missed an instruction issued by ground and as a result did not read back the correct instructions and was also not corrected by the controller.it is important to listen to all instructions closely as they are given and confirm them if any doubt exists. there were a number of distractions including talking to ground/tower, calling the ramp to find out the status of the gate, completing the after landing flows/checklist, and most importantly keeping a heads up awareness outside the aircraft especially in a designated hotspot.narrative: 2during the landing roll out, between 80 and 60 knots, tower commands take \"t or s, your choice\" to exit the runway. before the fo transfers controls i respond to tower that we can take t taxiway, the response i remember was \"...left t and contact ground.\"as we taxi off the first officer (fo) announces he is contacting ops and ramp on vhf 2 as i monitor vhf 1 for any further commands. i slow my taxi speed and head towards gg taxiway that points straight to the ramp of gate. before proceeding any further towards the gate i remain on b short of gg and wait for confirmation from the fo that we are cleared in to our ramp.once we receive word on who to wait for on the ramp the fo returns to vhf 1 and is able to get a word in with ground between the radio traffic and ground commands to \"continue on b hold short of g.\" i move a short distance down b taxiway holding short of g, indicated by the 3 amber lights and was blocked by an a320 on g holding short of runway 4.\\nlanding traffic on 31 exits on s taxiway and an airbus on a taxiway, ground commands the aibrus on a taxiway to taxi on g and b in front of me but they wanted to give way to us. ground commands us to taxi on b and hold short of f without delay. once i set the parking brake ground asks about if we are cleared into the gate. the fo responds with what ramp stated, \"one out cleared in\" but we were both confused because another aircraft had pushed back into the alley, and we asked ramp to clarify if we were cleared in behind the last outbound which he did verify.the next command from ground was to taxi \"f and a hold short of your ramp.\" once the last aircraft exited the fo told ground we were cleared in and i heard ground respond we were cleared in.as passengers were disembarking the gate agent told me there was an emergency phone call for me. the airport operations supervisor said that i had not complied with any instructions. that i was to taxi off of the runway and make a left onto b taxiway but did not. later was commanded to hold short of g and did not comply, and entered the ramp without clearance.have better coordination with ops, ramp, and ground. verify that the message

acting as pilot in command and pilot flying of a flight to little rock where an incorrect dh set for a cat ii approach led to two missed approaches. while setting up the flight we checked the weather forecast for little rock which was 1/2 sm and vv002 at our time of arrival. during our preflight briefing, we discussed the weather and to expect the cat ii approach. we read through the qrh cat ii checklist to familiarize ourselves with it and to review all the callouts. i then turned my attention back to the weather since the only cat ii approach was to 22r, yet the winds were out of the northeast. both the taf and metar were showing winds between 030 and 040 at 6-8 knots. since this was a tailwind, i reviewed both the poh and fom to verify the limitations for a tailwind on a cat ii. i determined that the winds were within limits. once airborne in cruise flight, i returned to the fom to verify the visibility requirements since the d-atis in little rock was not reporting rvr. i sent an acars message to dispatch asking to send the current rvr, which was 6000 rvr. we continued to discuss the weather and again reviewed the wind and visibility requirements for the cat ii approach, which we were still expecting. when about 30 minutes from landing, we received a new d-atis in which was reporting 030/7 1 sm vv003 and ils approaches to 4l. based on this atis, i elected to set up for the ils 4l and briefed that approach. just after briefing the approach, atc gave us a descent from fl360 to cross 30 nm east of lit at 10,000. i set that up in the fms and started the descent. the fo then called the fa's, sent the in-range and built the approach. about 20 minutes from landing, we were handed off to approach and checked in. we were given a vector and told to expect the ils 22r. at the same time, we received an auto-update of the atis with was now reporting back down to 1/2sm and vv002. i then briefed the cat ii for 22r. during the briefing, i stated that dh would be set to ra of 128. the fo stated, that it should be set to 362. for a moment, i hesitated, saying, no, it should be 128. however, because i was tired, and despite knowing it should be 128, i then believed that i was wrong and the fo was correct. we set the dh to [ra] 362 and continued the briefing and then ran the cat ii descent checklist. because of the error, we executed a missed approach and cleaned up the aircraft. i then did a quick fuel calculation for diversion fuel. we had about 8200 lbs on board and i calculated about 3000 lbs to divert to either of our 2 alternates. i then determined that we had enough fuel to make another attempt. we then reset the approach and double checked the course, frequency and altitude. at this time, still believing the dh set to 362 was correct, i did not change it when we reran the cat ii descent checklist. we were given vectors for the ils 22r and reconfigured for the approach in which we went missed again for the same reason. at this point i again checked out fuel, which was around 7,700lbs. i also realized that something was not right when an aircraft which was following us saw the runway and landed. i then realized that the dh set to 362 was in correct and that it should be 128. we verified this with the example on the descent checklist. we corrected the dh setting and i determined that we still had enough fuel to make one more attempt before having to divert. on this attempt, i saw the runway and landed with no further incident. there are several factors which led to this error. my attention was divided by the weather as well as being tired. although we reviewed the cat ii requirements, call outs, and approach plate prior to departing, i was fixated on the weather conditions. my major concern was if we were legal for the approach based on the winds and visibility. when we briefed the check list and call outs, we were focused on the weather and call outs, making sure we both knew what we were supposed to say, and did not discuss what the dh setting should be before we left. at the start of this flight, i was not feeling fatigue even though i had been awake for nearly 14 hours at that point. however, after being in the air for about a hour and half, i could feel fatigue\\nstarting to set in. when the time came to brief the cat ii, i was getting very tired and when the fo challenged me on the dh setting, my judgment was not clear. i did not trust my instinct which told me that i was correct and instead i believed the fo. since we had discussed the cat ii several times, i believed that we had the dh set correctly and since we were getting close to the airport, i did not ask to double check the setting with the example in the checklist. in the future, i will make sure that the dh setting is briefed as per the example provided and double check the setting if there is any question as to the correct setting.synopsisair carrier captain reported setting the incorrect decision altitude in the

flight was the result of a diversion of the original flight to zzz. after receiving clearance from approach for the visual into zzz was informed by the dispatcher via acars that the airport ops was reporting a notam of a ficon (field conditions) of ice (tower is closed at this point in time airport is uncontrolled). upon receiving this information myself along with the first officer and dispatcher concluded that a diversion was the best course of action at that point in time until we could get some better information on the conditions at zzz airport. diversion went as planned no issues. once parked and at the gate, i called the dispatcher to see if we couldn\\'t figure out a course of action. we discussed a couple of things as he was in direct contact with the zzz operations. eventually we were informed that the landing runway had been treated and the notam of 1/1/1 had been removed and the airport was reporting a ficon of 5/5/5 braking action good. we decided that based upon this information there was no reason that we could not proceed to zzz. we re boarded the airplane and proceeded on our way to zzz.the departure, enroute flight and approach were uneventful. after landing is when i noticed that we as a crew and the dispatcher had been misinformed. the runway was covered with ice and the braking action was very poor almost nil in some areas. i was able to eventually bring the airplane to a complete stop using brakes, and thrust reversers. we were able to gingerly taxi the airplane off of the landing runway onto the intersecting runway where we further started to slide about and ability to maintain aircraft control was almost impossible. we brought the aircraft to a complete stop again on the runway in a last effort to further taxi to the terminal we tried to turn north onto a taxiway and began to slide again uncontrollably eventually leading the aircraft almost doing a 180 with the tail facing north. we were able to get the airplane to stop on the taxiway now partially on the taxiway facing south with the airplane\\'s nose touching runway. after this we decided that further trying to taxi would not be a safe option so we shut down the engines and contacted operations as to our situation. stranded on our own for roughly an hour and a half we tried to come up with a plan while talking to the airport operations to which were pretty much left stranded on our own. the only help we received was a lone fireman that was able to help us deplane the passengers 2 to 3 at a time while making runs from the airplane to the terminal.late night, we were misinformed to the true state of the airport in zzz the airport was pretty much one huge sheet of ice. airport ops was no help as the airplane was unable to taxi as well as stuck on a taxiway about half a mile from the airport terminal. overall this is a huge learning experience on so many levels. i guess what bothers me the most is that in this situation there was a feeling of helplessness and frustration not with the company or the crew, but with the zzz facility and the information given to us prior to flying there and once on the ground. honestly it\\'s going to be hard for me to trust this station or\\nanything associated with it from now on. all of this could have been avoided if people were honest.narrative: 2we asked the station operations if they had transportation available to pick them up at the airplane and take them to the terminal, they stated they had none. we then had them get ahold of the local sheriff and fire departments to ask them for assistance, which he said he would do, in addition to calling the airport manager to ask him for any other options. two hours went by before we had anyone show up at our aircraft for assistance. it was one gentleman driving a pickup truck from the fire department. we decided to take advantage of his assistance, and started to deplane the passengers beginning with the elderly followed by families with their children, then the most irritated/outspoken. some of the passengers were becoming very unruly during this time, and threatened to walk off the aircraft and walk. we were able to appease them long enough to allow the fire department to assist them to the terminal. one particular passenger saw the truck driver pull up to the aircraft and yelled \"i\\'m getting off this airplane right now,\" and pushed his way out of the airplane and walked down to the truck. another truck driver pulled up after we had offloaded about half of the 45 passengers to assist. it took us approximately an hour and a half to finish deplaning everyone.in the meantime, the station had been treating the taxiway with an ice removal chemical, as they wanted us to finish taxiing to the gate. there was still patchy ice in several areas, so we decided to leave the plane where it was overnight. the station and our company wanted us to wait for a few hours to allow the rest of the taxiway to be cleared to accomplish this final portion of the taxi, but we discussed our level of fatigue between us two pilots and determined we were too exhausted to continue crew duty. we called in fatigue at this point, and finally got to our hotel at approximately 7:30 in the morning. there was no damage to the aircraft during this entire ordeal, and the airplane never left any portion of the prepared surface. in addition, no passenger was injured during the entire evening. there was nothing we could do to improve our situation. we were given incorrect information regarding the runway contamination and we did not do anything outside normal procedures.synopsiscrj-200 flight crew reported braking action was found to be poor or nil during landing despite good reports and the aircraft could not be taxied to the gate. the aircraft was shut down on a taxiway and the passengers were taken to the terminal in airport vehicles.']"
